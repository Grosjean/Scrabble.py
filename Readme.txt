This Python program allows to you cheat in scrabble by showing all possible playable words for a rack of letters.

Taking a set of letters as input through the command prompt, the program validates those letters against all possible words in a dictionary. Be sure to save the dictinary to your Doucments folder, otherwise it will download from the internet. 

The program then computes the value of each of those words and returns the dictionary either to command prompt if < 30 words, otherwise it prints to a 
textfile on your Desktop in a folder called Scrabble.

Hope you enjoyed my first mini program!
