This Python program helps you find a word to play in a game of Scrabble.

Taking a set of letters as input through the command prompt, the program validates those letters against all possible words in a dictionary. 

The program then computes the value of each of those words and returns the dictionary either to command prompt if < 50 words, otherwise it prints to a 
textfile.
